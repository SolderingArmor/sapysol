# sapysol

`sapysol` is a Solana Python wrapper. It doesn't reinvent what [solana-py](https://github.com/michaelhly/solana-py), [solders](https://github.com/kevinheavey/solders) or [AnchorPy](https://github.com/kevinheavey/anchorpy) do, but rather uses their power to create easy-to-use Python classes and wrappers to rapidly develop short and fast Python scripts to interact with Solana blockchain.

Like `@solana/web3.js` helps developers write JS code, `sapysol` will ease using blockchain technologies to more developers that prefer Python instead. More developers on board - better for the community and Solana.

`sapysol` can also serve as a base layer for other wrappers because it simplifies `Pubkey`/`Keypair` management, creating and sending transactions, tokens, instructions etc.

WARNING! `sapysol` is currently in `alpha` version, so, bugs, lack of tests and descriptions are expected. Some things may not work, future versions may bring breaking changes. It is a hard path for Python in Solana and I hope we hat a lot of friends along the way.

# Installation

```sh
pip install sapysol
```

Note: Requires Python >= 3.10.

# Usage

`sapysol` uses `Client` instead of `AsyncClient` for few reasons:
* First - without `async` you can put more logic to Python constructors and other non-async functions;
* Second - what is the point of `async` if you really use `await` in 100% of cases?

Please use `threading` if you need parallel execution.

```py
# ========================================
# Sending SOL to another wallet
from solana.rpc.api import Client 
from sapysol        import *

connection: Client          = Client("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com")
wallet:     SapysolWallet   = SapysolWallet(connection=connection, keypair="path/to/file.json")
result:     SapysolTxStatus = wallet.SendSol(destinationAddress="11111111111111111111111111111111", amountSol=0.5)
assert(result==SapysolTxStatus.SUCCESS)

# ========================================
# Jupiter swap
from solana.rpc.api import Client
from sapysol        import *
from sapysol.jupag  import SapysolJupag

connection: Client = Client("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com")
quote = SapysolJupag.GetSwapQuote(connection    = connection,
                                  tokenFrom     = "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
                                  tokenTo       = "DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263", # BONK
                                  inAmount      = 1 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL)
txB64 = SapysolJupag.GetSwapTxBase64(walletAddress=wallet.KEYPAIR.pubkey(), coinQuote=quote)
tx: SapysolTx = SapysolTx(connection=connection, payer=wallet.KEYPAIR)
tx.FromBase64(txB64)
result: SapysolTxStatus = tx.SendAndWait()
assert(result==SapysolTxStatus.SUCCESS)

# Contributing

All contributions are welcome! Although the devil is in the details:
* One of the main requirements is to **keep the same coding style** for all future changes.
* `sapysol` is designed as a wrapper, one layer above `solders`/`solana-py`, don't expect it to do very narrow or specific tasks. If you need custom behavior in your case just go one level down and implement that using `solders`/`solana-py` in your local scripts.
